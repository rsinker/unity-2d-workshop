# Unity 2D for Beginners COMPLETED

If you are attempting to download the template for the workshop, please return to the [main branch](https://github.com/rsinker/unity-2d-workshop/tree/main).

This is the completed branch, which demonstrates what the project will look like at the end of the workshop.
I have included a comment on every line of code explaining what it does.

## Software Requirements
I programmed this in Unity 2022.3.28, however any version of Unity should work.
