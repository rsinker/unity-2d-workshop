# Unity 2D for Beginners

This is the repository for the Unity 2D workshop I led at USC's Game Innovation Lab in 2024.

In this workshop I teach the fundamentals of Unity 2D and how to make a very basic 2D platformer.
This github repo provides a template for getting started in the workshop. I have provided a simple scene with a level created already, but it is up to you to make it a playable game.

For the completed code, see the [completed branch](https://github.com/rsinker/unity-2d-workshop/tree/completed). This branch includes a comment on every line of code with a brief explanation.

## Software Requirements
I programmed this in Unity 2022.3.28, however any version of Unity should work.
